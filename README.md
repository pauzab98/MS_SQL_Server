This is my first SQL database script. 
I created a database for the company from scratch by creating new tables defining primary and foreign keys. 
I added data to the tables and presented various commands. Here you can find basic and advanced data filtering and aggregation functions. 
Using relationships between tables I presented different types of joins and used the power of subqueries. 
The descriptions of the queries are written in Polish.
